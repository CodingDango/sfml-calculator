# Title
Simple Calculator made from scratch from SFML.
All assets are made by me.

## Requirements
❌ Feature to copy either the results text, or the input text to the os clipboard, through right clicking or left clicking.
❌ Add multiple evaluation, not direct evaluation. in simple words, multiple chaining of operators.
✅ Implement key inputs for user experience. CTRL-C to clear, press numbers, periods, etc.
✅ Buttons darken on hover.
✅ UI Looks decent.. not horrible.
