# Project Name
<b>SFML Calculator<b>

# Project Description
Simple Calculator made from scratch from SFML. <br>
All assets are made by me with Inkscape.

# Time Spent
It's been 2 weeks since I've starting; <br>
However, not all my time is spent on this project. <br> 
It's only for fun, even though the project idea is trivial

## Requirements
- ❌ Feature to copy either the results text, or the input text to the os clipboard, through right clicking or left clicking.
- ❌ Add multiple evaluation, not direct evaluation. in simple words, multiple chaining of operators.
- ✅ Implement key inputs for user experience. CTRL-C to clear, press numbers, periods, etc.
- ✅ Buttons darken on hover.
- ✅ UI Looks decent.. not horrible.
