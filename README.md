# Project Name
<b>SFML Calculator<b>

# Project Description
Simple Calculator made from scratch from SFML. <br>
All assets are made by me with Inkscape.

# Time Spent
It's been 2 weeks since I've starting; <br>
However, not all my time is spent on this project. <br> 
It's only for fun, even though the project idea is trivial
